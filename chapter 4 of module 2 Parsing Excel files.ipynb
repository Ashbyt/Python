    "So far in this module, you have learnt how to work with data in the formats that are machine readable, \n",
    "such as CSV, JSON and XML. \n",
    "The approaches used to import data in those formats are generally standard. \n",
    "However, not all data can easily be imported into Python or other programming languages without \n",
    "a fair amount of work.\n",
    "For example, with data stored in spreadsheets and PDFs. \n",
    "In these circumstances, data is generated purely for human consumption.\n",
    "The person who generated the data often tries to make it easily readable for human, \n",
    "disregarding the importance of releasing it in a machine readable format. \n",
    "In the following two chapters, we will look at two other file types, Excel spreadsheets and PDFs. \n",
    "We will provide some generic instructions on how to scrape data from these two file types. \n",
    "You will find that the scraping process becomes much more difficult and time-consuming. \n",
    "But the ultimate goal stays the same, i.e., extracting data and converting it into a machine readable format. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is a popular spreadsheet application originally \n",
    "developed for Windows. \n",
    "You can also find free alternatives that run on Mac OS and Linux,\n",
    "for example, LibreOffice Calc and OpenOffice Calc can both work with Excel files.\n",
    "An Excel document is also called a workbook. \n",
    "It is usually saved in a file with either .xlsx extension or .xls extension, \n",
    "depending on the Excel version you use.\n",
    "A workbook can contain multiple worksheets, each of which is a grid of cells\n",
    "where you keep and manipulate the data. \n",
    "Those cells are arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns.\n",
    "Excel can display not only tabular data but also data like line graphs, histograms and charts.\n",
    "It also provides a set of data analysis functions for statistical, engineering and financial needs.\n",
    "Presumably, most of you know what a Excel file looks like. \n",
    "If not, please find some Excel files online and have a look or open the Excel file used in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of manipulating data stored in Excel spreadsheets. \n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "\"[Working with Excel Files in Python](http://www.python-excel.org/)\" contains pointers to \n",
    "the best information available about working with Excel files in Python. \n",
    "The website lists the following Python packages that deal with Excel:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `openpyxl`: Reads/writes Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.\n",
    "* `xlsxwriter`: write text, numbers, formulas and hyperlinks to multiple worksheets in an Excel 2007+ XLSX file.\n",
    "* `xlrd`: Extracts data from Excel files (.xls and .xlsx, versions 2.0 onwards).\n",
    "* `xlwt`: Writes and formats Excel files compatible with Microsoft Excel versions 95 to 2003.\n",
    "* `xlutils`: Contains a set of advanced tools for manipulating Excel files (requires `xlrd` and `xlwt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You would need to install each separately if you want to use them;\n",
    "however, in this chapter we will use Pandas `ExcelFile` class that requires `xlrd` to demonstrate how to \n",
    "parse Excel files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tutorials on working with Excel files that might be of your interest:\n",
    "* [Working with Excel Spreadsheets](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter12/): It utilizes openyxl to read\n",
    "data from spreadsheets. Read the following sections:\n",

    "\n",
    "This chapter will use a running example to show\n",
    "you how to extract data from Excel spreadsheets step-by-step using Pandas.\n",
    "The example we use in this chapter is \"[Table 2: Nutrition](http://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/documents/english/EN-FINAL%20Table%202.pdf)\" from Unicef's report on \n",
